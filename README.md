A mobile app written purely by using JavaScript/TypeScript based on NativeScript framework.

It is my verry first coding developed for mobile application platforms - both iOS and Android. 

Hopefully it will result to a good one to be used for a long run.

Currently, it is for a demostration only.

It pulls survey data from my survey API platform via REST Protocol.

More to come soon!
